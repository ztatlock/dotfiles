In German Prisoner-of-War camps, escapes were a a major problem, so they would try to break the prisoners’ spirits by making them do mindless things. In particular, they would make the prisoners stand in a line and all move their heads like a clock back and forth and say, ‘tick tock tick tock.’

Some prisoners, unable to escape or otherwise change their situation, chose a very subtle rebellion. They would do the head motions, but instead of ‘tick tock tick tock’, they would wait until the guards were further down the line and switch to ‘tick tick tick.’

None of the guards noticed this was going on for many months, until finally, a young lieutenant was caught ticking by a senior SS Captain walking behind the line.

The captain stopped the exercise, walked over, face-to-face with the young man, and "A rebel. Vell, don’t vorry, ve have vays of making you tock.’

One day, on the savannah, a lion, a cheetah, an elephant and a warthog were all sitting around after their respective meals and discussing which species has the biggest potential for success. The elephant suggested that they settle this, once and for all, and that they take a cue from humans and test this by starting their own businesses, and then checking in in a month to see who did best.

The Warthog decided to hire other warthogs to occupy the shadiest groves, and then charged animals $5 to lay in the shade.

The Elephant built an elaborate harness for his back, and charged other animals $15 for elephant rides.

The Lion started a personal protection racket, offering gazelles protection from the lions in exchange for a fee of $10.

But the Cheetah had the best idea of all, starting a courier service, using his incredible speed to bring messages from animal to animal, all across the savannah, for $20. Within weeks, all the animals were using the Cheetah’s service to communicate, while the lion, elephant, and warthog sat mostly idle.

Finally, a month had passed, and the elephant, cheetah, warthog, and lion met up again with their bank statements to try and guess who might win. The Warthog had earned $150, the Elephant had earned $185, the Lion had earned $200. But Cheetah’s bank statement showed only $2. The other animals were shocked, because “Fast Cat Courier” was the most successful business by far. The other animals asked Cheetah what went wrong.

“Business has been great,” the spotted cat said, “but alas, Cheetahs never prosper.”

A king, wanting to host an elaborate wedding for his daughter, raised taxes on all citizens of the kingdom by thirty pieces of gold. Everybody paid, except for one young count.

The king sent a tax collector, but the count refused. “This is unfair, and I shall not pay!”

The king sent the sheriff, but the count refused. “I will not support the king’s new tax!”

Finally, the king had the count arrested, and thrown in the dungeon. He explained to the count that failure to pay was treason, and he would be executed, yet still, the count refused.

So, the king had him brought to the top of the tower, and neck on the block, with the executioner’s axe raised. The king asked the count to pay. He defiantly shouted, “Never!”

Then, as the executioner’s axe began to fall, the count shouted “OK! I’ll pay!”. But it was too late, the executioner couldn’t stop the heavy axe, and the count was killed.

Researchers for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority found over 200 dead crows near greater Boston recently, and there was concern that they may have died from Avian Flu.

A Bird Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone’s relief, confirmed the problem was definitely NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts. However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird’s beaks and claws.

By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car.

MTA then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.

He very quickly concluded the cause: When crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.

They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout “Cah”, not a single one could shout “Truck.”

“Hey, would you quiet down? I’m trying to cast spells”.

The man burst into a louder chorus still. The Warlock started to count.

“One!” The man banged the pots louder.

“Two!” The man started banging the pots on the cymbals.

“Three!” The Warlock raised his staff, shouted incantations to the sky, enveloped in a buzzing sphere of yellow light, hurling it towards the man and yelling “Now you are Koala!”

But the light dissipated as soon as it hit the man, and he kept on banging the cymbals and singing.

The Warlock shook his head. “That’s impossible! How did you not change?!”

The man looked over at the Warlock and shrugged. “It’s just like the last guy who wandered by said. I’m unbearable.”

One day, the man driving a large passenger train was texting with his new girlfriend and unthinkingly accelerated the train into a curve. The train went out of control and derailed, killing everybody on the train but him. After being sentenced to 98 counts of manslaughter at the trial, he was sentenced to death.

When the day finally came, the warden asked what he wanted as his final meal. He responded “Eighteen bananas and a cup of grain alcohol”. When the Warden questioned why, the man fell silent. But, trying to be compassionate, the Warden provided the bananas, which the man quickly and purposefully ate, one after the other. After refusing to talk to a priest, the man was brought into the death chamber and strapped into the electric chair.

Finally, all procedures completed, the Warden threw the switch. All the lights in the room went dim, but the man sat quietly in the chair, completely unaffected. After a full minute, the Warden cut the power, checked all the connections, turned up the current, and threw the switch again. A sharp hum echoed through the room, the lights flickering and dimming, but again, the man sat unaffected, tapping his fingers as if bored.

The Warden, clearly perplexed, went in back, checked the breakers, replaced the headband and tightened all the straps. He turned the current to the maximum, and threw the switch. The lights went out throughout the rest of the prison, the room filling with the sound of arcing power and the sharp smell of Ozone. But after two full minutes, the man in the chair shrugged, clearly bored, and the Warden turned off the power.

The Warden removed the man’s blindfold. “According to the law, if you survive three execution attempts, we have to let you go. But I’ve got to ask: was it the bananas and the alcohol that saved you, somehow?”

The man shook his head. “No. The jury said it themselves: I’m just a terrible conductor.”

Two men were sitting on the banks of the Vaal river, in South Africa, watching people wade across. They watched a short, young girl and her petite mother swim through without trouble. Then a tall man tried to wade across, and got swept away by the current. Then a group of young boys floated across on a log. Then a huge bear of a man, attempting to swim, was forced back to the shore, nearly drowning.

One says to the other, “You know, it’s odd that these huge men keep getting pushed back by the river while schoolchildren cross uneventfully.”

The other shook his head. “Not really. You know the old saying: The bigger you are, the harder the Vaal.”

Two old vulture buddies have been flying from New York to Florida every winter together for years. But one year they mutually decide that they’re too old to be flapping their wings for those many hundreds of miles, and they’re going to take a commercial airplane. So they make their reservations.

They arrive at the airport and walk up to the counter to check in. The agent, seeing that one of them has a suitcase, says ‘May I check that for you, sir?’

The vulture replies, ‘No thank you. It’s carrion.’

Sharon Miller, a prominent local architect, had been designing a beautiful stone porch for her mansion for several years. The process was racked with indecision, with changes to the design and materials coming nearly every week. At one point, she’d even ordered fifteen tons of a beautiful (and surprisingly inexpensive) shale to build the structure, which she paid for in full at the time, only to realize upon delivery that the stones, although gorgeous, were just too wide, which she felt didn’t perfectly capture the beauty of her intricate design.

So she put a tarp over the stone and went back to the quarry, eventually settling on an astronomically expensive figured marble, planning to buy on credit and hoping that an upcoming job in Tuscaloosa would pay her enough to cover the cost. But then, as the train to Tuscaloosa left the station, and while she was on the phone with her stonemason, she got a text message telling her that her design had been rejected.

And so it was that later, as Ms Miller rode the rails, that her porch, at first quite costly, used the wider, paid-off shale.

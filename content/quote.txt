Russell's Ten Commandments

1) Do not feel absolutely certain of anything.

2) Do not think it worth while to proceed by concealing
evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to light.

3) Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to
succeed.

4) When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from
your spouse or your children, endeavour to overcome it by
argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon
authority is unreal and illusory.

5) Have no respect for the authority of others, for there
are always contrary authorities to be found.

6) Do not use power to suppress opinions you think
pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you.

7) Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion
now accepted was once eccentric.

8) Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent that in passive
agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the
former implies a deeper agreement than the latter.

9) Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is
inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to
conceal it.

10) Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live
in a fool’s paradise, for only a fool will think that it is
happiness.

many instructions per second it can execute. Right?"

"So there is no way, really, to make code go faster, because there is no

making the machine do less."

Hierarchical systems have the property that something considered as an

when we shift our attention from one level to the next lower one.

We understand walls in terms of bricks, bricks in terms of crystals,
crystals in terms of molecules etc. As a result the number of levels that
can be distinguished meaningfully in a hierarchical system is kind of
proportional to the logarithm of the ratio between the largest and the
smallest grain, and therefore, unless this ratio is very large, we cannot
expect many levels.

In computer programming our basic building block has an associated time
grain of less than a nanosecond, but our program may take days of
computation time. I do not know of any other technology covering a ratio of
10^10 or more: the computer, by virtue of its fantastic speed, seems to be
the first to provide us with an environment where highly hierarchical

The way a programming language influences the thinking

"The greatest performance improvement of all is when a system goes from
not-working to working."

Programmers tend to worry too much and too soon about performance. Many
college-level Computer Science classes focus on fancy algorithms to improve
performance, but in real life performance rarely matters. Most real-world
programs run plenty fast enough on today's machines without any particular
attention to performance. The real challenges are getting programs
completed quickly, ensuring their quality, and managing the complexity of
large applications. Thus the primary design criterion for software should
be simplicity, not speed.

Occasionally there will be parts of a program where performance matters,
but you probably won't be able to predict where the performance issues will
occur. If you try to optimize the performance of an application during the
initial construction you will add complexity that will impact the timely
delivery and quality of the application and probably won't help performance
at all; in fact, it could actually reduce the performance ("faster"
algorithms often have larger constant factors, meaning they are slower at
small scale and only become more efficient at large scale). I've found that
in most situations the simplest code is also the fastest. So, don't worry
about performance until the application is running; if it isn't fast
enough, then go in and carefully measure to figure out where the
performance bottlenecks are (they are likely to be in places you wouldn't
have guessed). Tune only the places where you have measured that there is
an issue.

"Use your intuition to ask questions, not to answer them."

Intuition is a wonderful thing. Once you have acquired knowledge and
experience in an area, you start getting gut-level feelings about the right
way to handle certain situations or problems, and these intuitions can save
large amounts of time and effort. However, it's easy to become
overconfident and assume that your intuition is infallible, and this can
lead to mistakes. So, I try to treat intuition as a hypothesis to be
verified, not an edict to be followed blindly.

For example, intuition works great when tracking down bugs; if I get a
sense for where I think the problem is I can quickly go to the code and
verify whether this really is the problem. For more abstract tasks such as
design I find that intuition can also be valuable (I get a vague sense that
a particular approach is good or bad), but the intuition needs to be
followed up with a lot of additional analysis to expose all the underlying
factors and verify whether the intuition was correct. The intuition helps
me to focus my analysis, but it doesn't eliminate the need for analysis.

One area where people frequently misuse their intuition is performance
analysis. Developers often jump to conclusions about the source of a
performance problem and run off to make changes without making measurements
to be sure that the intuition is correct ("Of course it's the xyz that is
slow"). More often than not they are wrong, and the change ends up making
the system more complicated without fixing the problem.

Another reason for constantly challenging and validating your intuitions is
that over time this will sharpen your intuitions so that they work even
better for you. Ironically, people who are most dogmatic about their
intuitions often seem to have least well-developed intuitions. If they
would challenge their intuitions more, they would find that their
intuitions become more accurate.

"The most important component of evolution is death."

Or, said another way, it's easier to create a new organism than to change
an existing one. Most organisms are highly resistant to change, but when
they die it becomes possible for new and improved organisms to take their
place. This rule applies to social structures such as corporations as well
as biological organisms: very few companies are capable of making
significant changes in their culture or business model, so it is good for
companies eventually to go out of business, thereby opening space for
better companies in the future.

Computer software is a counter-example to this rule, with ironic results.
Software is incredibly malleable: it can be updated with new versions
relatively easily to fix problems and add new features. It is easier to
change existing software than to build new software, so software tends to
live a long time. To a first approximation, software doesn't die (compare
this to the hardware in a computer, which is completely repaced every few
years). At the same time, it is difficult to make major structural
improvements to software once it has been shipped, so mistakes in early
versions of the program often live forever. As a result, software tends to
live too long: just good enough to discourage replacement, but slowly
rotting away with more and more problems that are hard to fix. I wonder if
the overall quality of computer software would improve if there were a way
of forcing all software to be replaced after some period of time.

"Facts precede concepts."

A fact is a piece of information that can be observed or measured; a
concept is a general rule that can be used to predict many facts or a
solution to many problems. Concepts are powerful and valuable, and
acquiring them is the goal of most learning processes. However, before you
can appreciate or develop a concept you need to observe a large number of
facts related to the concept. This has implications both for teaching and
for working in unfamiliar areas.

In teaching it's crucial to give lots of examples when introducing a new
concept; otherwise the concept won't make sense to the students. Edward
Tufte describes this process as "general-specific-general": start by
explaining the concept, then give several specific examples to show where
the concept does and does not apply, then reiterate the concept by showing
how all the examples are related.

I also apply this principle when I'm working in a new area and trying to
derive the underlying concepts for that area. Initially my goal is just to
get experience (facts). Once I have a collection of facts to work from,
then I start looking for patterns or themes; eventually these lead to
concepts. For example, a few years ago I started working on my first large
Web application. My goal was to develop a library of reusable classes on
which to base the application, but being new to Web development I had no
idea what those classes should be. So, I built the first simple version of
the application without any shared code, creating each page separately.
Once I had developed a dozen pages I was able to identify areas of
functionality that were repeated over and over in different pages, and from
this I was able to develop a set of classes that implemented the the shared
functionality. These classes represented the key concepts of that
particular application.

"If you don't know what the problem was, you haven't fixed it."

Here's a scenario that I have seen over and over:

* A developer is tracking down a difficult problem, often one that is not
  completely reproducible.

* In a status meeting the developer announces that
  the problem has been fixed.

* I ask "what was the cause of the problem?".

* The developer responds "I'm not really sure what the problem was, but I
  changed xyz and the problem went away." 

Nine times out of ten this approach doesn't really fix the problem; it just
submerges it (for example, the system timing might have changed so that the
problem doesn't happen as frequently). In a few weeks or months the problem
will reappear. Don't ever assume that a problem has been fixed until you
can identify the exact lines of code that caused it and convince yourself
that the particular code really explains the behavior you have seen.
Ideally you should create a test case that reliably reproduces the problem,
make your fix, and then use that test case to verify that the problem is
gone.

If you do end up in a situation where you make a change and the problem
mysteriously goes away, don't stop there. Undo the change and see if the
problem recurs. If it doesn't, then the change is probably unrelated to the
problem. If undoing the change causes the problem to recur, then figure out
why. For example, try reducing the scope of the change to find the smallest
possible modification that causes the problem to come and go. If this
doesn't identify the source of the problem, add additional tracing to the
system and compare the "before" and "after" traces to see how the change
affected the behavior of the system. In my experience, once I have a code
change that makes a problem come and go I can always find the source of the
problem fairly quickly.

"If it hasn't been used, it doesn't work."

This is one of the biggest frustrations of software development. You design
and implement a new feature or application, you test it carefully, and you
think you are done. Unfortunately you aren't. No matter how carefully you
have tested, there will be problems as soon as QA gets their hands on it or
someone tries to use the feature or application for real work. Either there
will be bugs that you missed, or some of the features will be clumsy, or
additional features will be needed. Sometimes the entire architecture turns
out to be wrong. Unfortunately, the problems come out at a time when you
are ready to move on to the next thing (or perhaps you already have moved
on), so it's frustrating to go back and spend more time on a project that
you thought was finished. And, of course, you didn't budget time for this
so the cleanup work causes delays in your next project.

I don't know any solution to this problem except to realize its
inevitability and plan for it. My rule of thumb is that when you think you
are finished with a software project (coded, tested, and documented, and
ready for QA or production use) you are really only 50-75% done. In other
words, if you spent 3 months in initial construction, plan on spending
another 4-8 weeks in follow-up work. One way to minimize this problem is to
get your new software in use as soon as possible. If you can create a
skeletal version that is still useful, get people trying it out so you can
find out about problems before you think you're finished. This is one of
the ideas behind Agile Development. Sometimes people just refuse to do the
follow-up work: "It's not my highest priority" or "I will get to it when I
have time". If you take this approach you'll produce mediocre software. No
software is ever gotten right the first time. The only way to produce
high-quality software is to keep improving and improving it. There are 2
kinds of software in the world: software that starts out crappy and
eventually becomes great, and software that starts out crappy and stays
that way.

"The only thing worse than a problem that happens all the time is a problem

Not much to say about this one: it's painful to debug a problem that isn't
reproducible. I have spent as long as 6 months tracking down a single
nondeterministic bug. Conversely, in my experience any problem that can be
easily reproduced can also be tracked down pretty quickly.

"The three most powerful words for building credibility are 'I don't
know'."

Many people worry that not knowing something is a sign of weakness, and
that if a leader seems not to have all the answers they will lose the
confidence of their team. Such people try to pretend they have the answer
in every situation, making things up if necessary and never admitting
mistakes.

However, this approach ultimately backfires. Sooner or later people learn
the truth and figure out that the person never admits when they don't know.
When this happens the person loses all credibility: no-one can tell whether
the person is speaking from authority or making something up, so it isn't
safe to trust anything they say.

On the other hand, if you admit that you don't know the answer, or that you
made a mistake, you build credibility. People are more likely to trust you
when you say that you do have the answer, because they have seen that you
don't make things up.

"Coherent systems are inherently unstable."

A coherent system is one where everything is the same in some respect; the
more things that are uniform or shared, the more coherent the system is.
For example, a typical cornfield in Iowa is highly coherent: every corn
stalk is from the same strain; they're all planted at the same time,
fertilized at the same time, and harvested at the same time. The world of
computing is also fairly coherent: most of the world's computers run one of
a few versions of Windows, and almost any computer in the world can be
reached using the IP/TCP protocol. Human-engineered systems tend to be
coherent.

Natural systems tend not to be coherent. For example, consider the
ecosystem of a wetland: there are numerous different species of plant and
animal sharing the same area, but behaving very differently with complex
interrelationships. The behavior of the overall system is hard to predict
from the behavior of any individual in it.

Coherent systems often have advantages of efficiency, which is why humans
gravitate towards them. For example, it's easier to plant the same seed
everywhere in a cornfield, and given that some seeds are better than
others, it's more efficient to use the best seed everywhere. It's also
easier to harvest if all of the corn ripens at the same time. It's more
efficient to have a single operating system running most of the world's
computers: once a new facility is implemented for that system, everyone in
the world can benefit from it. If there were dozens of different operating
systems, then new applications would have to be reimplemented for each of
them.

Unfortunately, coherent systems are unstable: if a problem arises it can
wipe out the whole system very quickly. For example, a new plant disease
could quickly take out a large fraction of U.S. grain production. Computer
viruses are another example: a virus that takes advantage of a bug in
Windows can potentially impact most of the world's computers. The U.S.
stock market exhibits a certain degree of coherency in the way people think
and trade, which results in huge swings up and down as investors move en
masse to buy the latest fad or sell when a recession looms.

The incoherency of natural systems give them greater stability. For
example, a particular plant disease could probably only affect a small
fraction of the species in a wetland.

If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all
others of exclusive property, it is the action of the
thinking power called an idea, which an individual may
exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but
the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the
possession of everyone, and the receiver cannot dispossess
himself of it.

Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the
less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who
receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself
without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine,
receives light without darkening me. That ideas should
freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the
moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his
condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently
designed by nature, when she made them, like fire,
expansible over all space, without lessening their density
in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move,
and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or
exclusive appropriation.

Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.

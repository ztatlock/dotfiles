Researchers for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority found over 200 dead crows
near greater Boston recently, and there was concern that they may have died
from Avian Flu.

A Bird Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone’s
relief, confirmed the problem was definitely NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death
appeared to be vehicular impacts. However, during the detailed analysis it was
noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird’s beaks and claws.

By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had
been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with
a car.

MTA then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a cause
for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.

He very quickly concluded the cause: When crows eat road kill, they always have
a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.

They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout “Cah”, not a
single one could shout “Truck.”
